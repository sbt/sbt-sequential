This is the initial release of sbt-sequential. This plugin is somewhat experimental in nature.

Usage
-----

sbt-sequential implicitly adds `Def.sequentialTask[T]` method, which returns a sequential task.

    // sequential task
    lazy val integrationTestImpl = Def.sequentialTask {
      startServer.value
      val n = 1
      Thread.sleep(2000)
      stopServer.value
      n
    }

    integrationTest := integrationTestImpl.value
